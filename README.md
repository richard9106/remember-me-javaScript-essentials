[Responsively App](https://responsively.app/) was very helpful the diferent screen sizes are listed below:

### Cell phones

- Nokia Lumia 520 (320px - 533px)
- Nokia N9 (480px - 854px)
- Samsung Galaxy S20 (412px - 915px)

- Macbook Pro (1440px - 900px)

## Performance testing

I run [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) tool to check performance of the website.
I had to do couple of changes to improve performance. Screenshots are presented below:

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

# Deployment

The project was deployed on GitHub Pages. I used VsCode as a development environment where I commited all changes to git version control system.
I used push command in VsCode save changes into GitHub.

To deploy a project I had to:

* Log in to GitHub and click on repository to deploy ([remember-me-javaScript-essentials](https://github.com/richard9106/remember-me-javaScript-essentials))
* select `Settings` and find GitHub Pages section at the very bottom of the page
* from source select `none` and then `Milestone-Projects` branch.
* click `save` and page was deployed after auto-refresh.
>  Your site is published at https://richard9106.github.io/remember-me-javaScript-essentials/

To run localy:

### Firts method
* Log in to VScode account and link your repository to be open with VScode.
### Second method
* Creating a virtual space in gitHub https://github.com/richard9106/remember-me-javaScript-essentials open the repository and then click on CODE green buttom and create a virtual space.

* once it has been created you can open it with VScode directly from your virtual space.


## Credits

* To complete this project I used Code Institute student template: [gitpod full template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template)

* Ideas and knowledge library:

    * [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp)  I used code for JavaScript set interlvar functions.
